## About me

<p>I know how to follow the rules and I want others to
do the same
 exactly.  I am responsible for the tasks
assigned to me.  Always
ready to learn something new.
As a web developer, I do not have many
years of experience with CSS, JavaScript
and HTML. But I think my desire will allow
me to develop my skills in object-oriented
programming.</p>
